		~.prototype method is used for Consrtuctores of Objects and setPrototypeOf for literals which is discoureged.
		~ Sperad Operator is very powerfull, one use I learnt today to take it as a parameter when number of arguments are defined
	~ React 
		~ useMemo, useRef, useCalback-memo and others in details

		~ Learnt about Encaplutaion and Inheritence in classes and constructor functions
	~ React 
		~ Practices useMemo

		~ Learnt useCallback by practice 
		~ The useCallback hook is used for memoise the functions as when the fns passed from parent to child and if parent rerenders it creates the fn 		  again and passes it again thus to avoid unneccesary recreation of fn we use Callback 
		~ useRef , use of useRef.current, its used store dom and Storing Mutable Values without Triggering Rerenders (like times of rerender)
	~ Java 
		~ Revised Generics, inheritence in Generics (class and mutliple interfaces using &) and made notes
		~ Revised Exception Handling, use of Class runtimeException in custom Exception and throwable.
	~ JavaScript

		~ Got reminded for in loop iterates by key name and for of loop by values of those keys 
	~ React/Redux
		~ Prop Drilling : It involves passing state or functions through multiple layers of components from a higher-level ancestor to a lower-level                   descendant where the state is needed. Thus can be less efficient in large projects
		~ Recoil helps avoid prop drilling by allowing components to directly subscribe to and update the Recoil state they need, reducing the need to 		  		  pass state through multiple layers of components.
			~ So when you need local state magement use React Hooks and when multilayer or global state is used use Recoil
			~ useRecoilValue gives value of state useRecoilState gives value and setter fn and useSetRecoil gives only setter
